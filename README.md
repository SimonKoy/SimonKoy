### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Simon Koyounian and I am a graphic designer and programmer...<br>
Currently I am learning JavaScript and enlarging my programming knowledge of CSS and HTML website design. UI and UX {which can be used interchangeably} design is an integral component of every user experience.
<br>When designing websites, I believe it is important to consider not only the purpose of the website but also the visitor or user.  If their experience is enjoyable and efficient, the visitor {user} is more likely to return and or recommend it to friends and others.  The goal of targeting how to accentuate both UI/UX of website design must not be overlooked.</p>
<p>
I believe my graphic design background contributes to the UI/UX component of website design. The graphic design element combined with programming allows me to easily visualize how the potential visitor to the website will perceive their experience. Colour, images and typography are factors which influence how the content is presented to the visitor.
Experience has taught me that there is a difference between design processes in school and design processes within the real world working environment.</p><p>
There are factors which influence how the projects are executed in a working enviornment. Factors such as:<br>
â€¢ time constraints - sometimes time does not allow for extra "bells and whistles"<br>
â€¢ business constraints - sometimes the business does not venture into a specific neiche <br>
â€¢ technology constraints â€“ sometimes the technologies used are not current or available in the working enviornment<br>
These basic considerations along with the management team influence what is acceptable and probable within the business framework. Exposure to these challenges have an impact on achieving the goals of the business in house working enviornment.</p>
<p>
Experience is sometimes overlooked to favor the younger programmers. It must be admitted that there is talent among both categories yet investment in a young programmer does not in itself guarantee longevity with a business. In recent years, young and upcoming programmers usually attain some experience and in 1-2 years are out looking for other employment opportunities.
